Makerfabs provides two Lora communication solutions, MakePython Lora and Maduino Lora. This experiment introduces how to use SX127X series module for Lora transceiver communication across platforms.And realize a soil moisture detection project:

> With Lora chip SX127X series as the core, connect Makepython ESP32 Lora gateway, Lora Relay.The on/off state of Lora Relay is controlled with ESP32 via the Lora protocol.

```sequence

wifi-> gate : Timed query (request)
gate -> relay :Command signal (broadcast)
gate -> gate : Wait response
relay-> gate : Callback (broadcast)
gate->wifi : Humidity value (response)

```

## Equipment list

- [MakePython ESP32](https://www.makerfabs.com/wiki/index.php?title=MakePython_ESP32)
- [MakaPython Lora](https://www.makerfabs.com/wiki/index.php?title=MakaPython_Lora)

# STEPS

## 1 Lora Relay

- Arduino IDE to open \\LoraSensor\LoraSensor.ino

-  Connect the Lora Relay to PC through the download line and press the Moisture Sensor on the serial port welding plate with your hand on the other end.

- After saving, select "Tools", select "Development Board" Arduino Pro or Pro min, select processor ATmega328p 3.3V 8MHz, and select corresponding serial port.

- Open the serial port monitor and click "Upload" from the IDE interface.

- If all goes well, the serial port monitor will display startup module Settings, send messages and other information.

  ```c++
  18:27:44.956 -> LoRa radio init OK!
  18:27:44.956 -> Set Freq to: 433.00
  18:27:44.956 -> Set setPreambleLength to: 8
  ```
  
- Connect Relay with 12V DCã€‚Since the current of Pro Mini itself is not enough to drive the relay module, it is unnecessary to add 12V DC when connecting the power supply.

## 2 MicroPython Lora

- Plug the ESP32 and Lora extension boards together.

![7](https://github.com/Makerfabs/Project_Lora-Relay-Wifi/blob/master/md_pic/7.png)

- Connect MakePython ESP32 to your PC, open uPyCraft, and select connect to the serial port.
- Firmware will be prompted if it has not been burned before or for other reasons.Board selects ESP32, BURN_addr selects 0x1000, Erase_Flash selects Yes, com selects the port number.Firmware Choose Users, click Choose to Choose ESP32-IDF3-20190125-v1.10.bin in the folder.

- Download all python programs ending in.py from the \LoraS2G\workSpace to ESP32.

- Press the RST button on ESP32 to reset the development board.The
